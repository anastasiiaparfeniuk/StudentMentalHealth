Student Mental Health and Academic Performance Analysis
Overview

This project explores the relationship between students’ mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, panic attacks) and their academic performance (CGPA). Additional factors, such as marital status and age, are also examined to better understand trends in student well-being.

The analysis uses a dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mubeenshehzadi/the-state-of-student-minds 

Methods

Data Cleaning:

 - Standardized categorical values (e.g., Year1 → year1)

 - Checked for missing or inconsistent entries

Data Exploration:

 - Calculated counts and percentages for mental health conditions

 - Visualized distributions using bar charts and heatmaps

Analysis:

 - Examined correlations between mental health conditions and CGPA

 - Investigated relationships with age and marital status

Key Findings

 - Mental health conditions show minor variations across ages.

 - Depression is consistently prevalent across all age groups.

 - Anxiety peaks among students aged 21.

 - No strong correlation was observed between mental health conditions and CGPA.

Conclusion


This analysis indicates that while mental health conditions are prevalent among students, they do not appear to have a strong direct impact on CGPA in this dataset. Further studies could incorporate larger samples and additional variables for a more comprehensive understanding.
